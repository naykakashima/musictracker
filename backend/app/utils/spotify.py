# generate a random state string to prevent CSRF attacks
# create the spotify url to redirect the user to on the new port
# response_type, client_id, redirect_uri, state, scope, and show_dialog are all parameters that Spotify requires
# redirect the user to the Spotify URL
# once authentication is handled, you will receive two parameters in the URL: code and state
# if the state is not the same as the state you generated, this is a CSRF attack, so reject the request
# if the state is the same, you can now request an access token from Spotify
